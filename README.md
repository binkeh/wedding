# Budgie

Simple budgeting stuff

## Cool JS stuff:
  * React
  * Redux
  * ES6
  * Webpack
  * Babel
  * Hot Module Reloading (see below)
  * Source maps
  * eslint
  * Flow
  * seamless-immutable?

## Still to be added:
  * Jasmine + karma + phantomJS
  * redux-thunk? redux-saga?

## Also todo:
  * Remove dependency on estraverse. See:
    * https://github.com/babel/babel-eslint/issues/267
    * https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/5476
  * Add @flow to configureStore. Potentially waiting on: https://github.com/babel/eslint-plugin-babel/issues/55

### On HMR
  * HMR for components works normally.
  * HMR for reducers requires this Chrome plugin:
