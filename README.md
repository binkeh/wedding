# Budgie

Simple budgeting stuff

Built with all the cool JS stuff:
  * React
  * Redux
  * ES6
  * Webpack
  * Babel
  * Hot Module Reloading (see below)
  * Source maps
  * eslint

Still to be added:
  * Flow
  * Jasmine + mocha + phantomJS
  * redux-thunk? redux-saga?
  * Immutable.js? seamless-immutable?

### On HMR
 * HMR for components works normally.
 * HMR for reducers requires this Chrome plugin:
